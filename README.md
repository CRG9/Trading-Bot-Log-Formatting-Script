# Trading Bot Log Formatting Script

A Node.js script to parse, format, and enhance the readability of raw json log files and png images generated by a trading bot's activity.

## Description

Trading bots can produce large volumes of log data that are difficult to parse manually. This script provides a simple and effective way to process those raw logs and transform them into a structured, human-readable format. It can extract key decisions like trade entry, zone cancellation, and status updates, making it easier to analyze the bot's performance and troubleshoot issues to optimize performance.

## Features

*   **Log Parsing**: Ingests raw text-based json log files and png files outputted by a trading bot.
*   **Data Extraction**: Pulls out important information such as timestamps, trade details (buy/sell orders, price, volume), errors, and performance metrics.
*   **Visual Outputs**: Formats the extracted data into clean, organized png files that combine json log data and trading chart images into one organized visual for analysis.
*   **Flexible Input**: Process log files from multiple folders at once.
*   **Date Range Filtering**: Generate reports for a specific period by providing start and end dates.

## Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

    > **Note:** This project uses the `sharp` library for image processing. The `npm install` command will attempt to download a pre-compiled binary for your platform. If this fails, you may need to install additional system-level dependencies. Please see the sharp installation documentation for troubleshooting.

## Usage

You can run the script from your terminal by first navigating to the project's main directory where the script is present, then execute the following commands:

```sh 
# Example: Process a log file and print formatted output to the console
node process_logs.js <START DATE> <END DATE> <DATA FOLDER TO PROCESS 1> <DATA FOLDER TO PROCESS 2> ...

```

*(Note: The command-line arguments above are examples. You may need to adjust them based on the actual implementation.)*

## Configuration

Configuration options, such as log parsing rules or output formats, can be adjusted within the script files. See the source code for more details on customization.
